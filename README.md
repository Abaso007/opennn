# Build the most powerful models with C++.

OpenNN is an open-source neural networks library for machine learning that outstands in terms of execution speed and memory allocation. It is constantly optimized and parallelized in order to maximize its efficiency.
OpenNN solves many real-world applications in energy, marketing, health, and more.

This library contains sophisticated algorithms and utilities to deal with the following artificial intelligence solutions: Regression, Classification, Forecasting and Association.

The documentation can be found at the official <a href="http://opennn.net" target="_blank">OpenNN site</a>.

CMakeLists.txt are build files for CMake, it is also used by the CLion IDE.

The .pro files are project files for the Qt Creator IDE, which can be downloaded from its <a href="http://www.qt.io" target="_blank">site</a>. Note that OpenNN does not make use of the Qt library. 

OpenNN is developed by <a href="http://artelnics.com" target="_blank">Artelnics</a>, a company specialized in artificial intelligence.
